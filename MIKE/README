14:32, 26/07/2016 : Setting up all programs & GitHub for development of assessment task.
14:53, 26/07/2016 : Received an email from recruitment team about issues i have had with opening the files.
20:38, 26/07/2016 : After having email communication with recruitment team, unable to open the current project on my system.

21:23, 26/07/2016 : Initial thoughts on the project. To view the entire collection via command window is already within the sustem, will
                    look to add a addBike & getBikeId function to achieve the two requirements. 
                    I will look to add a interface on top of the classes so they are not directly accessed by the user. 
                    Deleting entries to the collection could possibly be done by bikeId however, this can increase chance of user error,
                    if delete is added, i will look into a prompt asking the user if they are sure they want to delete the item.
                    
22:39, 27/07/2016: After failing to get software requested to work on my system i have decided to submit a very abstract approach to the
                   problem. I will be using BlueJ and Java to create a game world which will swap bikes into the world and will hopefully
                   be colliable so they can detect mouse input. Once mouse input has been detected the game world will have a text box
                   overlay appear with the description and price of the Bike.
                   
                   I will spawn the bikes into the game world using an Object-oreiented pattern known as Factory pattern. This is a efficient
                   way to create items. Also coding in this way makes the code useable. (To some degree)
                   
                   I may venture into creating the bikes as Singletons however, i will see what problems arise before committing to this. 
                   As my main issue to involve mouse input as i have only previously used keyboard input.
