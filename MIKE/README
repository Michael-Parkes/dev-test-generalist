14:53, 26/07/2016 : Received an email from recruitment team about issues i have had with opening the files.
20:38, 26/07/2016 : After having email communication with recruitment team, unable to open the current project on my system.

21:23, 26/07/2016 : Initial thoughts on the project. To view the entire collection via command window is already within the sustem, will
                    look to add a addBike & getBikeId function to achieve the two requirements. 
                    I will look to add a interface on top of the classes so they are not directly accessed by the user. 
                    Deleting entries to the collection could possibly be done by bikeId however, this can increase chance of user error,
                    if delete is added, i will look into a prompt asking the user if they are sure they want to delete the item.
